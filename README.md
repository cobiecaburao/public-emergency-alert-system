# <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
The Nuclear Plant Public Alert System (PAS) is designed to provide timely and reliable emergency notifications to the
public within a designated Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ). For the system to maintain public trust, it must be secure 
and accurate, minimizing the risk of false alarms. This project implements conditional locking for live alerts, 
ensuring that notifications are only sent after multi-layered verification. By doing so, the system supports safe 
operation, effective training exercises, and confidence in emergency communications.

# <strong>Project Overview</strong><br>
This project focuses on improving the security and reliability of the PAS by introducing safeguards that prevent 
accidental or false alerts. The system allows authorized personnel to conduct training exercises without triggering 
real public notifications, while live alerts go through a layered verification process. The codebase includes 
modules for alert management, verif cation logic, logging, and audit tracking, making it suitable for both 
operational use and operator training scenarios.
